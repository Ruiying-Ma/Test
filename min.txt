1. touch min
	min: Untracked
2. git add min
	min: saved in buffer
3. revise "min" using vim
	Now there are two "min"'s: one is in buffer (original version), the other is unstaged (revised version)
Problem: If we "git commit" now, the one in buffer will be committed instead of the revised one. 
Solution: "git add" again

4. git add min
5. git commit -m "add min"
